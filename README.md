## Video as per scrolling
Here is a new Project by me which uses GSAP, javascript, HTML and tailwind, and renders a video which gets played on the basisi of scroll.
This animation, at first uses a video and braks it into frames, then on the basis of scrolling, all the frames are changed thus, giving animating effect like canvas.

** Simply run the project on live server to watch the animation.
